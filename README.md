**CSTL** is a standard template library for the C programming language, designed to provide a more modern programming experience for C language embedded developers. With CSTL, you can use common data structures and algorithms to improve the efficiency and readability of your C code.

CSTL is an open-source project. If you have any suggestions or encounter issues while using it, please feel free to provide feedback through [Issues](https://github.com/Chihaya-Yuka/CSTL/issues).

## Features

- **Rich Data Structures**:
  - Dynamic Array (`Vector`)
  - Linked List (`List`)
  - Stack (`Stack`)
  - Queue (`Queue`)
  - Dictionary (`Map`)
  - Set (`Set`)

- **Efficient Algorithms**:
  - Sorting (`Sort`)
  - Searching (`Search`)
  - Finding Maximum/Minimum (`Max/Min`)
  - Filtering (`Filter`)
  - Mapping (`Map`)
  - Reducing (`Reduce`)

- **Function Objects**: Supports unary and binary function objects, predicates, etc., for various operations within algorithms.

- **Generic Interfaces**: All data structures and algorithms are implemented with generic interfaces, supporting generic programming.

- **Simple and Easy to Use**: API design similar to C++ STL, making it easy for C developers to get started.

## Example

Look at `example.c` to get the example.
